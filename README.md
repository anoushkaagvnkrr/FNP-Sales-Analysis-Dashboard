# FNP-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
Developed an interactive Excel dashboard for Ferns and Petals to analyze sales data. Answered key questions on revenue trends, top products, customer spending, and city-wise performance. Used data cleaning, modeling, and visualization techniques to deliver actionable insights, aiding strategic decision-making and business growth.

Objective:
The project addresses the following key questions:

What is the total revenue generated by FNP?
How many orders were placed in total?
What is the average customer spending?
What is the average time between order placement and delivery?
Which product categories generate the most revenue?
What are the top-selling products?
How does revenue vary month-to-month?
Which occasions drive the highest sales?
Which cities contribute the most to the revenue?
At what time of day does the business earn the highest revenue?
Procedure:
The analysis began with importing and preparing raw sales data in Excel. The data was cleaned by handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies to ensure it was accurate and usable. Revenue was calculated using Excel formulas, and insights were derived by grouping data based on different dimensions such as cities, occasions, months, and product categories.

Dashboard Implementation:
A dynamic dashboard was developed using pivot tables, slicers, and various chart types like bar and line graphs. The dashboard features interactive filters for order date, delivery date, product category, and occasions, allowing users to explore the data in real-time. Key metrics such as total orders, total revenue, average customer spending, and average delivery time are highlighted for quick reference.

Outcome:
The dashboard provides valuable insights, such as identifying the most profitable products, peak revenue-generating months, top-performing cities, and customer spending patterns. These insights empower businesses to optimize their product offerings, plan better for peak seasons, and target high-performing markets effectively.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Excel’s analytical and visualization tools to extract meaningful insights from raw data, making it a valuable addition to any business’s decision-making toolkit.
